LibManage (A library management system made using C++) (2007-2008)

For school project in C++ in standard 12, I developed LibManage. This was done using the latest version of Visual C++ packaged in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition which is available for download for free. Working for this project I was introduced to Standard C++.
